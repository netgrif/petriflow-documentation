# Low-coding Petriflow apps in Netgrif

This guide will show you how to get started with Netgrif low-code platform. The guide will show you to use Netgrif platforms to create and deploy applications in low-code language Petriflow.

An applications in Petriflow language is given by a set of Petriflow classes, also called Petriflow processes. When Petriflow application is deployed, a user can create objects of Petri flow classes, also called instances or cases of Petriflow processes. 

Petriflow language was designed to make development of process-based web applications easier and faster when compared with traditional full stack development. To do this, Petriflow abstacts from traditional three-layer architecture, when data layer, application layer and presentation layer of web applications are developed separatelly and then interconnected. Instead, a Petriflow class contains definition of data layer, application layer and presentation layer.

More preisely, a Petriflow class consists of:
* data attributes,
* life cycle of the objects of the class given by a workflow process that consists of tasks,
* forms containing subsets of data attributes that are associated with tasks.

Netgrif low code platform consists of:
* Netgrif application builder, and 
* Netgrif application engine.

Netgrif application builder available at https://builder.netgrif.com is a tool that supports graphical creation of Petriflow classes by drawing worklows and drag-and-dropping data forms.

Netgrif application engine is an interpreter of Petriflow applications. It may either be downloaded from github https://github.com/netgrif or used after registration at https://etask.netgrif.cloud/. 

In this guide we will use https://builder.netgrif.com to build examples of Petriflow classes, to describe generated code in Petriflow language and then deploy generated Petriflow classes using https://etask.netgrif.cloud/.
